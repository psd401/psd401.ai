## Welcome to PSD401.ai

At Peninsula School District, we've fully embraced artificial intelligence in education, leading the way in exploring AI's impact on both instruction and operations. As we've shared our work with districts across the country, we recognized the need for a central hub to showcase how our staff and students are using AI. This website serves as that hub - a place to share examples, stories, and use cases that demonstrate how AI is transforming our schools.

This site also serves as our experimental ground for testing new AI technologies in storytelling. We'll be implementing interactive elements inspired by platforms like [Every.to](https://every.to/p/introducing-extendable-articles), allowing us to refine these approaches before incorporating them into our district's primary communications.

### What You'll Find Here

Our content is organized into six key sections:

- **Guidance & Guidelines**
  While we haven't established formal policies, we've developed comprehensive guidance for staff, students, and parents to navigate AI integration. This section provides access to all our current guidelines and frameworks.
- **Blog**
  Explore firsthand experiences from across our organization - from practical how-to guides and impact stories to in-depth technical articles.
- **Presentations**
  Access our repository of presentations given to both internal and external audiences, showcasing our AI initiatives and learnings.
- **Tools**
  Browse our curated catalog of AI tools available to our staff and students, including:
- Purchased products

- **Research & Articles**
  Stay current with our carefully curated collection of articles and research on AI's impact in education, helping you find answers to your questions about AI integration in schools.
- **Use Cases**
  Inspired by [EdTech Insiders](https://www.edtechinsiders.ai/), this section catalogs particularly impactful AI applications in our district. Instead of just linking to specific websites, we share detailed prompts and methodologies that can be adapted to any AI tool.
