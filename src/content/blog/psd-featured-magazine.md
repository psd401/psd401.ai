Peninsula School District’s (PSD) thoughtful approach to AI implementation continues to draw national attention. In a new K-12 Dive article examining key AI trends for 2025, our district’s strategic work offers valuable insights for other education leaders navigating this transformative technology.

Chief Information Officer Kris Hagel highlights several critical considerations for districts exploring AI integration:

## Enterprise Solutions vs. Public Tools

While free AI tools like ChatGPT may be tempting, Hagel emphasizes the importance of controlled, secure enterprise systems — especially when handling sensitive student data. Our district is exploring how to leverage AI for special education services through secure, private environments where data handling is transparent and protected.

## Building Understanding

A key challenge Hagel identifies is the need to help education leaders understand AI’s underlying technology.

“Something’s going to have to happen to get people to understand the underlying technology behind AI so that they can feel more comfortable with moving forward with it,” Hagel said.

## Looking Ahead

The article positions PSD among districts leading the way in responsible AI adoption. While many districts are still hesitant to embrace AI tools, our approach demonstrates how schools can thoughtfully experiment with this technology while maintaining strong privacy protections and focusing on evidence-based implementation.
