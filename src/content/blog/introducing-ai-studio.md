PSD is proud to announce the availability of AI Studio, our secure home for access to frontier generative AI models for staff and students. AI Studio will enable users to:

- Quickly switch between models like OpenAI's GPT-5, Anthropic's Claude Opus, Google Gemini, and more
- Use custom developed chat models for instructional and operational tasks
- Design their own AI assistants using prompt chains and parallel prompts - without needing to write code!

## What Are Frontier Generative AI Models?

“Frontier” models are the most advanced and capable AI systems available today. They represent the cutting edge of generative AI research and development, built to handle complex reasoning, generate high-quality text, analyze data, and even create new content across multiple formats. Unlike free or limited versions of AI tools, frontier models are faster, more reliable, and better aligned to educational and professional needs.
Because models all have relative strengths and weaknesses, it's important to have a range of capabilities available to get the best results. By giving students and staff access to these models, PSD ensures that our learning community has the same tools currently being adopted in universities, businesses, and research institutions worldwide.

## How AI Studio Keeps Costs Down and Data Secure

One of the most important design choices behind AI Studio is how it connects users to these powerful models. Instead of requiring individual subscriptions where every prompt and response is routed directly through a third-party company, **AI Studio uses secure API calls managed inside PSD’s own server environment.**

Here’s what that means in practice:

- When you use AI Studio, your data is processed within the district’s secure servers.
- Only the minimum necessary information is sent to the AI models, and no identifying student or staff data leaves the PSD environment.
- This architecture ensures that our prompts and outputs remain private, while still taking advantage of the latest generative AI capabilities.

The result: **cutting-edge access at a fraction of the cost.** In fact, as of September 2025, AI Studio has reduced costs by 90% compared to paying for individual licenses.

## Built with AI, For AI Users

AI Studio isn’t only a platform for using AI; it’s also a product of AI collaboration. From the earliest stages of development, our team leveraged generative AI agents to help design, troubleshoot, and refine the system.
This meant:

- **Faster Prototyping:** AI helps generate and test multiple design options in a fraction of the time it would take a human.
- **Smarter Troubleshooting:** When issues arise, generative AI models act like coding partners, suggesting fixes or optimizations that speed up debugging.
- **Iterative Improvement:** Instead of long development cycles, AI allows for quick iteration. We can adjust features, test them, and roll out updates much more rapidly than in traditional projects.

In short, AI Studio demonstrates what’s possible when humans and AI collaborate. It’s living proof that generative AI can streamline development, cut costs, and unlock innovation.
