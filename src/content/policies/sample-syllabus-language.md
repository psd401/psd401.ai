**Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use in the Classroom: Guidelines and Responsibilities**

In alignment with the Peninsula School District's commitment to Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and ethical AI use, this classroom embraces AI technologies to enhance educational experiences and support diverse learning needs. AI tools, such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude, Canva, MagicSchool, and Midjourney, are incorporated to assist in personalizing learning and offering various ways for students to express their knowledge and engagement. Students are encouraged to explore and utilize AI tools while maintaining a strong ethical compass, ensuring that their use of these technologies aligns with academic integrity and promotes responsible digital citizenship.

**Expectations for Students:**

- Thoughtful Interaction: Engage with AI tools thoughtfully and deliberately, understanding their capabilities and limitations. Recognize when AI is appropriate for authentic learning and when it is not.
- Responsible Use: Use AI responsibly, ensuring it aligns with the assignment goals and contributes positively to learning outcomes. Credit or cite AI resources when used rather than claiming the output as entirely human-generated. Consider the ethical implications of AI use, such as potential biases in AI-generated content.
- Open Dialogue: Maintain an open dialogue about AI use, seeking guidance to enhance learning while addressing concerns about technology application. Transparency and collaboration are key to effective AI integration.
- Accountability: Remember that you are ultimately responsible for any work submitted using AI tools. This includes the accuracy of information, implied meanings, and proper attribution of sources used in the process. Always verify AI's outputs and ensure they meet academic standards.

We aim to foster a dynamic, inclusive, and forward-thinking educational environment by integrating AI tools into our curriculum. Our goal is to prepare students to navigate and shape the evolving landscape of technology and society while balancing the human element and AI assistance.

**Key Points to Remember:**

- Effort Matters: AI usage is a skill. Practice and patience are required to improve your results.
- Verify Information: Do not blindly trust AI responses. Always verify facts or numbers provided by AI tools.
- Acknowledge AI Use: At the end of any project or assignment where you've used AI, explain how and why you used it and what prompts you used. This transparency is essential for academic honesty.
- Ethical Considerations: Be mindful of the ethical implications of using AI, including bias and data privacy.

Using AI tools in class can be a fun and exciting way to learn. By embracing these guidelines, we can ensure that AI enhances our educational experience while upholding the values of integrity, inclusivity, and responsible technology use.
