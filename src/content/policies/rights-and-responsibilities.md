## Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use in the Classroom: Guidelines and Responsibilities

In alignment with the Peninsula School District's commitment to Universal Design for
Learning (UDL) and ethical AI use, this classroom embraces AI technologies to enhance
educational experiences and support diverse learning needs. AI tools, such as ChatGPT,
Google Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, Canva, MagicSchool, Midjourney, etc., are incorporated
to assist in personalizing learning and offering various ways for students to express their
knowledge and engagement.

### Guidelines for AI Use:

- Educational Enhancement: AI is used as a supplementary tool to augment the teaching provided by educators, assisting in tasks ranging from generating creative content to providing analytical insights. It is crucial to treat AI as an aid, not a replacement for traditional learning methods or teacher guidance.
- Critical Engagement: Students are encouraged to engage with AI outputs critically, questioning and verifying the information generated. It is the student's responsibility to ensure the accuracy of their work, even when using AI-generated content.
- Ethical Use and Integrity: All work submitted should accurately use citations to acknowledge the use of AI tools, specifying how and why AI was utilized. Transparency in the use of AI prevents academic dishonesty and fosters an environment of integrity and honesty.
- Inclusivity and Accessibility: AI tools should be used in ways that are inclusive of all students, including those with disabilities and multilingual learners. Efforts will be made to ensure that AI resources are accessible to everyone and sensitive to diverse needs.
- Data Privacy: In using AI technologies, the privacy and security of student data are paramount. Students and educators must adhere to district guidelines on data handling, ensuring that personal information is protected and AI interactions comply with our data security policies.

### Key Points to Remember:

- Effort Matters: Carefully writing your prompts to AI tools is crucial for getting excellent results. Practice and patience are required to improve your skills.
- Verify Information: Do not blindly trust AI responses. Always verify facts or numbers provided by AI tools.
- Acknowledge AI Use: At the end of any project or assignment where you've used AI, explain how and why you used it and what prompts you used. This transparency is essential for academic honesty.
- Ethical Considerations: Be mindful of the ethical implications of using AI, including bias and data privacy.

By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure that AI enhances our educational experience while upholding the values of integrity, inclusivity, and responsible technology use. Our goal is to prepare students to navigate and shape the evolving landscape of technology and society while balancing the human element and AI assistance.
