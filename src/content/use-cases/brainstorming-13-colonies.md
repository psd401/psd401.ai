## Overview

We're using the teacher created classroom in Magic School AI, where students were given literacy and writing tools to help develop ideas for a narrative writing project connected to their 13 colonies learning. Students were tasked with learning about responsibilities or jobs that younger kids could have had at the time in colonial Boston. Once they selected a job, students were asked to use Raina to help come up with descriptive words and details for their setting writing.
