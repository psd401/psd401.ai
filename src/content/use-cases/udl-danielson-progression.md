## Overview

We needed an updated document that included our district's Big 6 UDL Look-Fors and a progression based on the Danielson framework. We had a previous document for our first 3 UDL Look-Fors, but it needed to be updated in order to include our additional 3 in the 2024-2025 school year.

## Prompt Used

```md
Create a UDL Look-Fors Quantitative Progression for the following Focus Areas;

1. Learning Objectives
2. Collaboration & Community
3. Flexible Methods
4. Formative Assessments
5. Self-Reflection
6. Feedback.
   The progression should include descriptors for each focus area that detail what unsatisfactory, basic, proficient, and distinguished would look like in a classroom.
   Using the Danielson document attached, please identify which Danielson components align with each of the 6 UDL look-fors.
```
