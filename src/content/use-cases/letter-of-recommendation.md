## Overview

I was trying to write a last minute letter of recommendation for a senior whose second letter of rec did not get done on the day scholarship notebooks were due.

## Prompt Used

```md
Please write a one page letter of recommendation for a senior student in Comparative Media who is a bright, creative and independent thinker. He works well in collaborative teams, is a leader by example and sets high expectations for himself.
```

## Other Content Provided

He is a theatre student who excels in the technical aspect, and though I have only had him in class this semester, I have watched him from the theatre side-lines for four years of his high school career.

## Any Other Info

I revised the draft to give it my own voice. I would usually NOT use AI for a letter of rec, but in this case, I was thankful that I could get something drafted quickly to help the student meet the deadline, especially since it was not his fault that the other teacher did not follow through.
