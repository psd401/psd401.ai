## Overview

Students in grades 2-5 interacted with Teachable Machine to interact and develop understanding of machine learning. Machine learning is introduced and discussed, and then students used the website to create datasets using their cameras. 2/3 students created an AI machine that could tell the difference between a stuffy and themselves. 4/5 students attempted to train the AI to know the difference between equivalent and non-equivalent fractions using drawings. Students create the data, and then run the AI machine to check their work. Adjustments are often required of the data (photos), which is a great connection to how and why AI predicts.
