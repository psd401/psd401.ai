## Overview

Though students weren't using the image generators (teacher led), students in K/1 classes did a "Monster Mad Lib" creative writing activity. Students would complete the mad lib writing in a small group, and the teacher inserts the prompt into their chosen image generator. Students get once chance to verbally adjust the prompt with the teachers based on the first image. After completion, the teacher prints the picture and the mad lib description to send home to families.
