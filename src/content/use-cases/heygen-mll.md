## Overview

An ELL student was unable to present information to the class as part of a slide presentation assignment. While she could conduct research and create the slides, she was unable to speak English fluently enough to communicate her ideas during the presentation.

## Project Description

She developed a slide presentation showcasing her research on change agents in the realm of humanitarian aid. Her findings were articulated in Ukrainian, and with the help of HeyGen, seamlessly translated into English. Collaborating with her team, they chose to present their insights through a TED Talk, requiring her to pair a compelling narrative with the visuals and content she had meticulously crafted.

## Other Content Provided

We captured photos of her to create an image avatar. Although it wasnâ€™t a video avatar and felt a bit clunky, it brought a smile to her face. The images were incorporated into the slideshow, and the avatar was programmed to speak in English, allowing her to present her portion of the TED Talk.
