## Overview

Used across K-5 students, Quick, Draw! is an interactive tool for students to learn about AI datasets. Students interact with the AI through a drawing game, where the AI predicts and guesses their drawings based on hundreds of thousands of user created drawings within it's dataset. Students can look back at the data to see what and why the AI guessed what it did. It's a great way to show datasets in action, and can also be connected to data and information behind chatbots in general.
