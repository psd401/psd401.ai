## Overview

The state testing manuals are lengthy and the content needed is often spread throughout the documentation. A few accommodations have some complex considerations for teams to think about prior to testing.

## Prompt Used

```md
/Canvas Create an interactive decision helper for using some specific accommodations in state testing. Use the Focus on text-to-speech, speech-to-text, scribe, stacked translations, and human reader. Use content from this link: https://wa.portal.cambiumast.com/content/contentresources/en/24-25%20Guidelines%20on%20Tools_%20Supports_%20and%20Accommodations_Final%20(2).pdf. for the app's contents. When the user selects an accommodation, provide a list of considerations for implementation using content from the linked document. Include a reset button at the bottom of the app.
```

## Other Content Provided

Because o1 can't accept attachments as of 01/28/25, a link to the state's Guidelines on Tools, Supports, and Accommodations was provided in the prompt.

## Any Other Info

The app generated can be interacted with in Canvas's preview mode or copied and deployed in a different environment.
