## Overview

My grandkids were struggling with meeting grade appropriate reading levels. They complained the books they can read are boring. I taught my daughter to write prompts for level appropriate stories for her kids to read. She has the kids talk about what they would like to happen in the story and she feeds that into the prompt. Each day the kids get a new timed reading lesson based on their current reading levels. At first some of the words were too big, but she trained the prompts to use easier words until the kids were challenged without interrupting the story.

## Prompt Used

```md
My child is struggling with her reading. She is in the second grade but not able to read at a second grade level. Will you write a 15 minute story about a little girl with blue hair and her pet unicorn? They both like to eat candy. The story should use sentence structure and vocabulary for a 1st grader learning to read.
