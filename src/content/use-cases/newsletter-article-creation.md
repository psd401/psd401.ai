## Overview

Support principals with a toolkit of resources that could be used with their communication to staff. In an effort to keep UDL at the forefront of our instructional work and help folks see the connection to the Danielson Instructional Framework, we wanted to create short actionable newsletter blurbs that could be included in a principal's weekly communication to staff.

## Prompt Used

```md
Assume the role of a building principal who is helping teachers understand the 2022 Danielson Instructional Framework and the connection to UDL principles. Create 5 different newsletter blurbs that could shared with staff. Each blurb should include a short an action step that the teacher can incorporate into instruction that day.
```
