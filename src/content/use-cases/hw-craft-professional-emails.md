## Prompt Used

```md
I am a 7th grade teacher. I have a student in my class who is consistently off task. He fidgets, blurts, disrupts others' learning, and is disrespectful. One-on-one he is respectful and assures me he will try to behave. Though I have redirected him and assigned lunch detention, his behavior continues to decline. Create an email to his parent outlining this issue using professional wording.
```
