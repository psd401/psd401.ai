## Overview

For the District Focus on Education: Innovation Event featuring 37 different educators/schools, AI tools were utilized to streamline the communication process. The project involved creating and customizing email templates to manage booth hosts' various needs and requirements. Each template needed to be adapted for specific booth requirements while maintaining consistent event information and professional communication standards.

## Prompt Used

```prompt
Help me draft an email to individuals who requested a booth at our Focus on Education Event on the evening of December 4th. The goal of the email to confirm their application and to verify their technical supplies needs. Here is a sample provided by a booth application.
```

## Other Content Provided

- Excel spreadsheet containing booth applications and descriptions
- Contact information for booth hosts
- Excel spreadsheet detailing booth supply requests

## Additional Information

The initial prompt required refinement to handle cases with missing information. The user modified the prompt to include instructions for handling omissions or additions when booth information was incomplete. This adaptive approach ensured comprehensive communication despite varying levels of detail in the booth applications.

The project supported the Strategic Plan Goal of Innovation by facilitating effective communication for an event showcasing innovative educational practices across the district.
