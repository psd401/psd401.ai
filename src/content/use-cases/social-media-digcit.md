## Overview

A multi-platform social media campaign was developed to support Digital Citizenship and Cyberbullying Prevention during October (Bullying Awareness & Online Safety Month). The campaign focused on educating families about six key concepts for online safety and friendly digital interactions. The initiative aimed to provide resources and preventative tools for families and students facing online challenges.

## Additional Information

The creator noted that the image generation process presented the biggest challenge. A key learning was that focusing on desired actions and scenarios rather than keywords proved more effective in generating appropriate visuals. The campaign was structured as a 6-day series across multiple platforms (Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn) to maximize reach and engagement with families.
