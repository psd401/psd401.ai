# AI-Powered Writing Feedback in English Class

## Overview

In my 11th grade English class, I've integrated Claude AI as a writing assistant to help students improve their essay writing skills. The AI provides detailed feedback on structure, clarity, and argumentation, which students use to revise their work before peer review and final submission.

## Implementation

1. Students write their initial draft in Google Docs
2. They share their draft with Claude AI for feedback
3. Claude provides specific suggestions on:
   - Thesis statement clarity
   - Argument structure
   - Evidence usage
   - Transitions
   - Grammar and style
4. Students revise based on AI feedback
5. Peer review follows for additional human perspective
6. Final revision and submission

## Results

Students have shown significant improvement in their writing skills. The immediate, detailed feedback helps them identify patterns in their writing and make meaningful revisions. The combination of AI feedback and peer review creates a comprehensive learning experience.

## Tips for Implementation

- Set clear guidelines for how to use AI feedback
- Emphasize that AI is a tool, not a replacement for critical thinking
- Have students reflect on the AI feedback they receive
- Use AI feedback as a starting point for class discussions about writing

## Student Feedback

"Getting immediate feedback helps me catch mistakes I wouldn't have noticed. It's like having a writing tutor available 24/7."

"I appreciate how specific the feedback is. It's not just 'this needs work' but actually explains what needs improvement and why."
