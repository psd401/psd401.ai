## Overview

I want to assess how my students are doing with their comprehension of our recent topic in Social Studies: Feudalism. I want to save time grading, and I want quick data, so I am using Google Forms. Gemini canâ€™t create a form FOR me, so I asked it to help me ask questions and to help me differentiate for my diverse student population. I will take the information from Gemini, change it to suit my specific needs, plug it into a Google form, and put it in Schoology where it will be graded automatically and data will be display for me to inform my next steps in the unit.
