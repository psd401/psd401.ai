## Overview

I regularly use AI to comb through large technical manuals for specific configuration parameters. Some of my manuals are several hundred pages and specific information is sometimes spread across multiple manuals. ChatGPT can read the manuals and direct me to the correct sections in seconds, where combing the manuals manually would take many minutes or even hours.

## Other Content Provided

I upload that manuals and tell the prompt to answer by reading the manuals and providing answers from the manuals first and then search the internet if a conclusive answer is not found in the manuals.
