## Overview

An interactive bingo card was developed using AI to enhance student and family engagement at the Focus on Education: Innovation Event. The tool was designed to encourage attendees to visit as many educational booths as possible, making the experience more interactive and engaging through gamification.

## Prompt Used

```prompt
1. I need to make a passport or bingo style card for my focus on Education event. I can you help me create a list of things based on the booth titles & descriptions that will help encourage people to go to as many booths as they can. can you produce the solution in a table that is 5x5.

2. can you rework these to be a little less specific and more kid friendly language
```

## Other Content Provided

- Excel document containing staff applications with booth details and descriptions

## Additional Information

The development process included two main phases:

1. Initial creation of the 5x5 bingo card layout based on booth information
2. Refinement of language to be more kid-friendly and accessible

After finalizing the bingo card design, the same AI session was utilized to create accompanying game directions for participants. This additional step ensured clear understanding of how to participate in the engagement activity during the event.

The tool successfully served its purpose of encouraging broader exploration of the educational innovations on display while making the experience more enjoyable for young participants.
