## Overview

We had a community survey that had 689 responses. In addition to multiple choice questions, there were many short answer questions. We wanted to ensure that we not only read each individual response but were also able to articulate general themes that were being conveyed for each question.

## Prompt Used

```md
The following question was posed in a survey, "Insert Question." Review all responses and develop 8-10 themes that can through in the responses. Also include a brief 1 to 2 sentence summary of the themes.
