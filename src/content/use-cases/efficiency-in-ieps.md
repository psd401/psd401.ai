## Overview

I support teachers with students who have various reading abilities. In the older grades specifically, students are given articles to support their learning or do research. This creates a need for students to have modified materials- this is where AI comes in. We are able to take the articles that the class is reading and bring them to a reading level that is accessible to the student.

## Project Description

After generating and/or leveling a text for the desired reading level, I ask the chatbot to create a list of (x number) key vocabulary words with definitions. I will also either run the text through the summarizer or ask the chatbot to summarize the main points of the text.

## Other Content Provided

In most cases, I would just attach the article that was given to the students. If I was generating an article I would type in the standard and any details that I specifically wanted in the article.

## Any Other Info

This is a very quick process and easy to use process. Magic School AI also provides some questions and recommended prompts to get you to your desired outcome.
