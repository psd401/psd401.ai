## Overview

The ChatGPT extension with VS Code has been invaluable for my Game Programming (Unity) class. With the extension, you can interact directly with scripts (similar to co-pilot). Without this tool, most students would be severely limited with the scope of their project as many students entered the course without a strong coding background. This not only allows students to progress with their game ideas, but it doubles as a incredibly valuable learning experience. Beyond the code itself, students are required to prompt about why certain scripts and methods work, and to add comments.

## Project Description

The prompts used vary widely and are very task speci

## Other Content Provided

The extension accesses the code that the student is working on and provides that as context to the prompt.

## Any Other Info

We have found that for complex tasks, access to o1 model (plus subscription) produced far higher quality code.
