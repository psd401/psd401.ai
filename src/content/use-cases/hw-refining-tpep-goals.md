Help me write a student growth goal around non-fiction and informational reading and interpretation based on the following: In Washington, the teacher must set specific, measurable goals for individual students or subgroups of students based on their learning needs, identifying areas where they need to make the most progress academically; this is considered a key part of differentiated instruction and personalized learning.
