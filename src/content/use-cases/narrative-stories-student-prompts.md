## Overview

We used teacher-led ChatGPT usage and students using Schoology to create narrative stories based on student writing prompts. 2/3 students were given a writing template in a Schoology discussion within my course. They were to copy and paste into a comment, edit and add information (characters, setting, etc.) and then post within the discussion. I would then copy their prompt into ChatGPT, run it with the directive of something similar to "write a short 3 paragraph narrative story based on the following story elements, at a 2nd and 3rd grade level:" We would read the story together and then I would paste into our Schoology discussion for them to have access to it. We added "created by ChatGPT AI" at the top. 4/5 students were given more flexibility in their prompt writing in our Schoology discussion, though we modeled a variety of ideas together first.

## Any Other Info

Template prompts were giving within Schoology for those who needed them, while others were given required story elements and more flexibility.
