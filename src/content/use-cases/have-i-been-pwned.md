## Overview

Automatic notifications of compromised passwords and breach information

## Prompt Used

I started with:

```md
I have an HaveIBeenPwned.com subscription and that includes their api.

I would like to build a script that uses this api on a schedule against our on prem active directory.

Here is the API v3 webpage. let me know if you have any questions.
```

It then took days of revisions and testing to get a working product that was ready for limited testing with real user accounts.
