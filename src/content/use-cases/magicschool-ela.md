## Overview

One significant challenge we faced in our ELA classroom was students using AI tools without a shared understanding of how to approach them responsibly. Many students viewed AI as a shortcut for completing assignments. Establishing guidelines and norming as a class prevents confusion about the appropriate use of these powerful tools.

To address this issue, I initiated a process to establish clear guidelines and boundaries for using AI, specifically through the Magic School platform. We began by engaging in discussions about the role of AI in education, emphasizing that it is an optional part of the workflow rather than a replacement for critical thinking and creativity. By creating a supportive environment, students began to understand that AI can enhance their learning experience when used responsibly.

As part of this initiative, we implemented the "Getting Started with Magic School" lesson, which included a video that outlined the platform's features and benefits. Following the video, students answered a series of questions to reinforce their understanding. Upon completion, they received a certificate, which they proudly shared with me. This activity not only provided them with a solid foundation for using the platform but also aligned with our standards for production and distribution of writing in a multimodal context, as we integrated technology into our learning process.

I also shared with students that I utilize AI as a teacher to enrich my lessons and provide additional resources. This transparency helped demystify the technology and encouraged students to view it as a collaborative tool rather than a crutch. Together, we explored various features of Magic School, enabling students to enhance their writing, research, and overall learning in ELA.

Ultimately, this process not only fostered a sense of responsibility in using AI but also shifted our classroom culture towards viewing technology as a valuable resource that complements their education. By establishing these norms, we have created a more engaged and informed classroom environment.
