## Overview

Simple prompt used to generate examples, explanations and activities to teach people prompt engineering concepts.

## Prompt Used

```md
I need your help to explain prompt engineering examples, the audience will be speech & language pathologists in our suburban K-12 school district. I will give you a topic, then I need you to give me a short explanation that will make sense to people who may have no background in the topic (metaphors or analogies are always helpful), and then I need you to give me some examples that might resonate with the audience so that I can show them what it actually looks like in practice for their role. The examples should be in the format of a scenario and a prompt used to show the pattern. After you give the examples, also provide an activity that these educators could do individually using generative ai tools to help learn or reinforce the topic. Make sure it is one that will resonate with the audience. When you are ready for the first topic, let me know.
```
