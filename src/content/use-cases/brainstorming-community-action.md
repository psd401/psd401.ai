## Overview

PSD and local faith leaders have been partnering for a few years and realized that reversing the impacts of the phone-based childhood needs to be a whole village effort. We pulled community leaders together and are planning a campaign to launch in the fall. So I have used AI to help pull out key elements and data from the book, identify key stakeholders to involve, and find communities around the world who are taking collective action. As we move forward it will help summarize and use survey data, and create promotional materials for our fall launch.

## Prompt Used

One I used was:

```md
identify specific communities who have taken collective action with campaigns to limit teen smartphone use and encourage a play based childhood
```

## Other Content Provided

I provided the model with our strategic plan, the mission and vision of the PSD/Faith Leader partnership, and paired those with the book summaries to help work towards a one-pager defining the initiative

## Any Other Info

AI has been a valuable tool for both saving time and bringing large amounts of data together and making it usable, and will be even more so as we move forward
