# Using AI for Essay Writing Support

This guide demonstrates how to effectively use AI tools to support the essay writing process while maintaining academic integrity.

## Recommended Approaches

### 1. Brainstorming Ideas

```prompt
I need to write a 5-paragraph essay about [TOPIC]. Can you help me brainstorm 3 main arguments that could support my thesis? For each argument, provide 2-3 potential pieces of evidence I could research further.
```

### 2. Creating Outlines

```prompt
I'm writing an essay about [TOPIC] with this thesis: [THESIS]. Can you help me create a detailed outline? Include spaces where I should add my own research and evidence.
```

### 3. Finding Research Questions

```prompt
I'm researching [TOPIC] for my essay. What are 5 specific questions I should investigate to develop a strong argument? For each question, suggest one potential source type (academic journal, news article, primary source, etc.).
```

## Guidelines for Students

1. **Always Cite AI Usage**

   - Mention AI tools in your methodology
   - Keep records of prompts used
   - Submit both AI-assisted and final versions

2. **Maintain Original Work**

   - Use AI for ideas, not final content
   - Rewrite all AI suggestions in your own words
   - Verify facts independently

3. **Focus on Learning**
   - Use AI to understand concepts better
   - Ask for explanations of complex ideas
   - Use AI feedback to improve writing skills

## Example Workflow

1. Use AI for initial brainstorming
2. Research topics independently
3. Create rough outline with AI assistance
4. Write first draft yourself
5. Use AI for revision suggestions
6. Edit and finalize independently

## What to Avoid

- Don't ask AI to write complete paragraphs
- Don't use AI-generated citations without verification
- Don't submit AI-generated text as your own
- Don't rely solely on AI for fact-checking

## Teacher Support

Teachers can:

- Review student prompts
- Suggest improvements
- Monitor AI tool usage
- Provide guidance on ethical use
