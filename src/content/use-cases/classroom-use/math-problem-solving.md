# Math Problem Solving with AI

A guide for using AI tools to enhance mathematics instruction and learning.

## Recommended Approaches

### 1. Understanding Complex Problems
```prompt
I'm working on [MATH CONCEPT]. Can you break down this problem step by step:
[PROBLEM]
For each step, explain:
1. What we're doing
2. Why we're doing it
3. How it connects to the next step
```

### 2. Generating Practice Problems
```prompt
Create 3 practice problems similar to this one:
[EXAMPLE PROBLEM]
For each problem:
1. Make it slightly different in complexity
2. Include step-by-step solutions
3. Highlight key concepts used
```

### 3. Checking Work
```prompt
Here's my solution to this math problem:
[PROBLEM]
[MY SOLUTION]
Can you:
1. Check if my answer is correct
2. Point out any mistakes
3. Suggest improvements to my approach
```

## Best Practices for Teachers

1. **Pre-lesson Planning**
   - Generate varied example problems
   - Create scaffolded practice sets
   - Develop solution guides

2. **During Class**
   - Use AI for real-time problem variations
   - Generate hints rather than full solutions
   - Create differentiated practice problems

3. **Assessment Support**
   - Generate similar problems for practice tests
   - Create answer keys with detailed explanations
   - Develop rubrics for complex problems

## Student Guidelines

1. **Productive Struggle**
   - Try problems independently first
   - Use AI for hints, not answers
   - Break down complex problems

2. **Understanding Process**
   - Ask for explanations of steps
   - Connect concepts to previous learning
   - Verify solutions independently

3. **Practice Strategies**
   - Generate similar practice problems
   - Check work and understand mistakes
   - Create study guides with AI help

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Relying on AI for answers without understanding
- Skipping the problem-solving process
- Not verifying AI-generated solutions
- Using AI during tests without permission

## Success Metrics

Track:
- Problem-solving confidence
- Understanding of concepts
- Independent work quality
- Test performance
- Student engagement
