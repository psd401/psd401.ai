## Overview

I needed support developing a grant to align with program goals and data.

## Project Description

I utilized the new file upload (Projects) in ChatGPT to give all my program working document, along with handbooks, and data sheets. Then I asked it the questions from the grant and checked the responses!

## Other Content Provided

So much! I wanted it to be an expert in CTE so I also prompted that. I tried to give it websites as well that were included in the grants.

## Any Other Info

I was awarded the grants! Over $200,000 so far! It took time and prompting but less time than it would have on my own.
