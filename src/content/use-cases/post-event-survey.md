## Overview

This use case demonstrates the development of a comprehensive post-event feedback survey for staff who hosted booths at the Focus on Education Innovation Event. The AI tool was used to create structured Likert-scale questions addressing key event aspects (timing, date, compensation, resources, and support) along with carefully crafted open-ended questions designed to elicit constructive feedback rather than complaints.

## Prompt Used

```prompt
1. I am writing up an event feedback form, can you help me set up the questions. this is for staff who worked booths/principals. I want to create a likert that rates things like time, date, pay, resources, support, & also 2 open ended questions for successes, and growth

2. can you restructure the last a question to support and "If this occurs" occurs again and maybe shift it to gather information that is achievable. I don't want to elicit complaining but instead get constructive feedback.
```

## Other Content Provided

- Context from previous conversations about the event

## Additional Information

The process included several key components:

1. Initial survey question development
2. Refinement of questions to encourage constructive feedback
3. Export of final survey to Google Forms
4. Development of accompanying email communication to distribute the survey

The iterative approach to question development, particularly the revision of open-ended questions, helped ensure the feedback would be actionable and constructive rather than purely critical. This methodology aligned with the goal of gathering meaningful insights for future event improvement.
