# Automated Feedback Improves Teachers’ Questioning Quality in Brick-and-Mortar Classrooms

## Article Summary

Teachers used an AI tool that transcribed portions of their instruction, analyzed the transcript for question types, and then provided feedback to the teacher toward improving their use of “focusing questions.” While teachers using the tool did change their questioning techniques in statistically significant ways, other aspects of their instruction were unchanged. While research supports this use of focusing questions, this study did not examine student achievement.
