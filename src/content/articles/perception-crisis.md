# The Perception Crisis: How Educational Institutions Are Missing AI Reality

## Article Summary

The article discusses the growing disconnect between how institutions perceive and respond to AI versus its actual capabilities and usage in 2024-2025. Using Andrew Maynard's framework of three interrelated curves (capability, utilisation, and perception), it argues that while AI capabilities are rapidly expanding across multiple dimensions like reasoning and multimodal integration, institutional responses remain stuck in outdated paradigms from early 2023. The author contends that this isn't just a matter of falling behind technologically, but rather a fundamental failure to recognize how AI has evolved from a mere tool into an ambient part of our cognitive environment. This perception gap is particularly problematic in educational settings, where policies and frameworks designed to control AI use are becoming increasingly obsolete as the technology becomes more sophisticated and seamlessly integrated into daily digital life.
