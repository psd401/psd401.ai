# Collaborating with AI Agents: Field Experiments on Teamwork, Productivity, and Performance

## Article Summary

This experiment randomly assigned human-human and human-AI teams to develop and improve marketing materials. AI tools were also prompted with a range of “personality” traits. While human-AI teams sent more messages within the team and the humans on those teams were more productive with higher quality outputs, overall team performance was similar across team types. The study contains some support for strategic pairing of human and AI personalities to maximize performance, similar to what past research has suggested with teams entirely composed of humans.
