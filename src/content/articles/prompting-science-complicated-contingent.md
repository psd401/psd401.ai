# Prompting Science Report 1: Prompt Engineering is Complicated and Contingent

## Article Summary

This report from March 2025 indicates that prompt engineering techniques and approaches have inconsistent results. Specifically, politeness, once thought to improve LLM outputs, was shown to sometimes reduce output quality. These results emerged from repeated trials with identical prompts; for an individual user, evaluating the quality of each individual output remains key.
