# The Impact of Generative AI on Critical Thinking: Self-Reported Reductions in Cognitive Effort and Confidence Effects From a Survey of Knowledge Workers

## Article Summary

This study surveyed professionals using AI about: 1) the cognitive effort required to perform tasks with an AI, 2) their confidence in LLM’s outputs, and 3) the critical thinking skills they used when looking at AI outputs. The results showed a decline in professionals’ critical thinking when their confidence in AI outputs is high. Critical thinking when working with AI also occurred at different times in the professionals’ process; for example, verifying information rather than determining where to acquire the information. An important note: the measurement of critical thinking here is self-reported surveys focused on reflection that were completed after performing AI-assisted tasks. A baseline for the amount of critical thinking and reflection for these professionals is not available.
