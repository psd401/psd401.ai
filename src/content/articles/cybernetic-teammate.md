# The Cybernetic Teammate: A Field Experiment on Generative AI Reshaping Teamwork and Expertise

## Article Summary

An experiment at Proctor & Gamble compared performance across four categories: an individual working alone, an individual working with GenAI, a pair of professionals, and a pair of professionals working with GenAI. Solution performance was as high for individuals working with GenAI as it was for teams, with teams using GenAI having three times the likelihood of an exceptional solution as an individual working alone. Participants using GenAI reported experiencing more positive emotions and fewer negative emotions than those who did not use AI.
