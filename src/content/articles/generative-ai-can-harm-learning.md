# Generative AI Can Harm Learning

## Article Summary

Students were taught a review lesson and then were randomly assisted to one of three practice sessions: open book with no devices, access to an LLM optimized for tutoring, or access to an LLM with no optimization. Students with no device scored similarly to students using the optimized LLM scored similarly to students who had no device access and better than students with the unoptimized LLM. This suggests that care be taken to custom fit LLMs to their purpose.
