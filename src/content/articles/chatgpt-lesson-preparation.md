# ChatGPT in lesson preparation – Teacher Choices trial

## Article Summary

The UK’s Education Endowment Foundation conducted a trial looking at the effects of AI in teachers’ lesson preparation in KS3 (middle school) science teachers. Teachers using AI spent 31% less time per week planning lessons and preparing resources when compared to their peers without AI. As evaluated in the study, lesson materials did not differ in quality between each group.
