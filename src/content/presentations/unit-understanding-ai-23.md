**2/3 Unit: Artificial Intelligence (AI) - An Introduction for Young Learners**

This unit plan introduces 2nd and 3rd-grade students to the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) through a series of interactive activities. The unit aims to demystify AI and demonstrate its applications in a way that is accessible and relevant to young learners.

**Key Concepts:**

- **What is AI?** AI is introduced as code that simulates human intelligence, enabling machines to understand language, recognize patterns, and make decisions.
- **Types of AI:** Although not explicitly stated, the activities touch upon reactive, predictive, and generative AI through examples.
- **Datasets:** The concept of datasets as collections of curated data (images, measurements, text, video) that form the "brain" of AI is explained.
- **Machine Learning:** Students are introduced to machine learning through activities like Teachable Machine, where they train a computer model.
- **Coding and Algorithms:** While not as prominent as in the K/1 unit, the mention of copying and pasting story elements for the chatbot activity could be a subtle introduction to basic coding concepts.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Students will understand a general definition of AI.
- Students will understand that AI is based on datasets.
- Students will be able to use Google's Quick Draw to see how AI "thinks" and makes predictions.
- Students will understand the analogy of machine learning as a cake (explained through a video).
- Students can have a teacher use an AI image generator to create a visual representation of their creative writing.
- Students can learn and interact with machine learning by interacting with the Teachable Machine website.
- Students can work with a small group to add a set of story elements for a chatbot to generate a story.
- Students can explore with any of the AI learning tools used in the unit.

**Activities:**

- **Day 1: What is AI and Data Sets with QuickDraw:** Introduction to AI and datasets using Google's Quick Draw. Students play a game where they draw for an AI and it tries to guess what they are drawing, learning about datasets in the process.
- **Day 2: Creative Writing using Schoology Discussion and AI Image Generators:** Students engage in creative writing and use AI image generators to create visuals based on their stories, using a Schoology discussion forum.
- **Day 3: Machine Learning with Teachable Machine:** Students create datasets and train a machine learning model to classify different hand positions (numbers 1 and 5).
- **Day 4: Story Writing with AI Chatbots:** Students use chatbots like ChatGPT to help them write stories, collaborating in small groups and using a Schoology discussion forum.
- **Day 5: Free Choice with AI Tools:** Students choose from various AI tools (Quick Draw, image generators, Teachable Machine, ChatBot storytelling) to explore further.

**Assessment:**

- **Unit Rubric:** Based on ELA and ISTE standards, focusing on writing narratives and curating information from digital resources.

**Additional Notes:**

- **"AI or Not?" Game:** A game to help students distinguish between AI and non-AI technologies.
- **"What Cake Can Teach Us About AI" Video:** An analogy to help students understand machine learning.
- **Teachable Machine:** Students train a model to recognize different hand positions, learning about datasets and prediction accuracy.

**Looking Ahead:**

This unit plan provides a fun and engaging introduction to AI for 2nd and 3rd-grade students. By combining hands-on activities with age-appropriate explanations, the unit demystifies AI and helps students understand its basic principles. The focus on datasets, machine learning, and creative applications lays a foundation for future learning about AI and its applications. The use of tools like Quick Draw, Teachable Machine, and AI image generators provides a tangible and interactive way for students to experience AI in action. The unit also encourages creativity and collaboration, allowing students to explore AI's potential in a playful and imaginative way.
