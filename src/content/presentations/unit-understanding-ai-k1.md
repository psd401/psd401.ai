**K/1 Unit: Artificial Intelligence (AI) - An Introduction for Young Learners**

This unit plan, designed for kindergarten and first-grade students, introduces the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) through a series of engaging, hands-on activities. The unit aims to demystify AI and demonstrate its applications in a way that is accessible and relevant to young learners.

**Key Concepts:**

- **What is AI?** AI is introduced as code that simulates human intelligence, enabling machines to understand language, recognize patterns, and make decisions.
- **Types of AI:** The unit plan touches upon reactive, predictive, and generative AI.
- **Datasets:** The concept of datasets as collections of curated data (images, measurements, text, video) that form the "brain" of AI is explained.
- **Machine Learning:** Students are introduced to machine learning through activities like Teachable Machine, where they train a computer model.
- **Coding and Algorithms:** Students get hands-on experience with coding using the Dash robot and the Path/Wonder apps, learning about events, actions, loops, and algorithms.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Students will understand a general definition of AI.
- Students will understand that AI is based on datasets.
- Students will be able to use Google's Quick Draw to see how AI "thinks" and makes predictions.
- Students can program a Dash robot to complete puzzles and directions.
- Students can have a teacher use an AI image generator to create a visual representation of their creative writing.
- Students will learn how AI is impacting the world of pets (through a video).
- Students can explore with any of the AI learning tools used in the unit.

**Activities:**

- **Day 1: What is AI and Data Sets with QuickDraw:** Introduction to AI and datasets using Google's Quick Draw. Students play a game where they draw for an AI and it tries to guess what they are drawing, learning about datasets in the process.
- **Day 2: Creative Writing using Schoology Discussion and AI Image Generators:** Students engage in creative writing and use AI image generators to create visuals based on their stories.
- **Day 3: Story Writing with AI Chatbots:** Students use chatbots like ChatGPT to help them write stories, the learning objective is mislabeled as day 3, but it's the content of day 2.
- **Day 4: Machine Learning with Teachable Machine:** Students create datasets and train a machine learning model to classify different hand positions, and watch a video about AI and pets.
- **Day 5: Free Choice with AI Tools:** Students choose from various AI tools (Quick Draw, image generators, Dash robots) to explore further.

**Assessment:**

- **Unit Rubric:** Based on ELA and ISTE standards, focusing on writing narratives and curating information from digital resources.

**Additional Notes:**

- **"AI or Not?" Game:** A game to help students distinguish between AI and non-AI technologies.
- **Dash Robot Activities:** Students learn basic coding concepts (events, actions, loops, algorithms) by programming Dash robots.
- **Monster Mad Lib:** A creative writing activity where students use adjectives to create descriptive stories, which are then visualized using an AI image generator.

**Looking Ahead:**

This unit plan provides a fun and engaging introduction to AI for young learners. By combining hands-on activities with age-appropriate explanations, the unit demystifies AI and helps students understand its basic principles. The focus on datasets, machine learning, and coding lays a foundation for future learning about AI and its applications. The use of tools like Quick Draw, Teachable Machine, and Dash robots provides a tangible and interactive way for students to experience AI in action. The unit also encourages creativity and collaboration, allowing students to explore AI's potential in a playful and imaginative way.
