**Engaging and Authentic AI Instruction in K-5: A Hands-On Approach**

This presentation by Justin Towner, Innovation Specialist at Pioneer Elementary, provides a practical guide for K-5 educators on integrating AI instruction into the classroom through engaging, hands-on activities.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Personal Introduction and Expertise:** Towner establishes his credibility with 16 years of teaching experience, participation in ISTE's AI course, membership in PSD's AI Action Research Team, and attendance at Stanford University's AI Tinkery workshop.
- **Focus on Interactive Learning:** The presentation emphasizes hands-on activities that allow students to directly interact with AI tools and concepts.
- **Comprehensive Learning Outcomes:** Educators will be able to use and interact with several AI tools for instruction:
  - **AI or Not Sort:** Distinguishing between AI and non-AI technologies.
  - **Quick, Draw!:** Exploring AI datasets and prediction through a drawing game.
  - **Teachable Machine:** Creating datasets and training machine learning models.
  - **Image Generators:** Using AI to create visuals based on text descriptions.
  - **Chatbots:** Utilizing chatbots for story creation and writing support.
  - **Deepfake Creation:** Understanding the creation and implications of deepfakes.
- **Defining AI and Datasets:** The presentation provides a clear definition of AI and introduces the concept of datasets as collections of curated data that power AI's "thinking" process.
- **Quick, Draw! as a Learning Tool:** Students use Google's Quick, Draw! to understand how AI learns and makes predictions based on datasets.
- **Machine Learning with Teachable Machine:** Students create datasets and train machine learning models to classify images (e.g., happy vs. sad faces), exploring the relationship between data and AI's ability to learn.
- **Chatbots for Storytelling and Writing Support:** Students use chatbots (teacher-led ChatGPT or student-led Magic School's Raina) to generate stories based on provided elements and to receive feedback on their writing.
- **AI Image Generation for Creative Writing:** Students use AI image generators to create visuals that complement their creative writing, sparking discussions about the AI's interpretation of their descriptions.
- **Deepfakes for Digital Citizenship:** Students learn about deepfakes and the importance of being critical consumers of digital content.
- **Resource Sharing:** Towner provides links to his AI instructional slideshows for various grade bands (K/1, 2/3, 4/5).

**Actionable Insights:**

- **Implement the "AI or Not" Activity:** Engage students in sorting activities to distinguish between AI and non-AI technologies.
- **Explore Quick, Draw!:** Use Quick, Draw! to introduce students to datasets and AI prediction.
- **Experiment with Teachable Machine:** Guide students in creating datasets and training machine learning models for various classification tasks.
- **Integrate Chatbots into Writing Activities:** Utilize chatbots for story generation and writing support, providing opportunities for students to interact with AI in a creative and meaningful way.
- **Use AI Image Generators for Visual Storytelling:** Combine creative writing with AI image generation to enhance student engagement and explore the relationship between text and visuals.
- **Address Deepfakes and Digital Citizenship:** Introduce students to the concept of deepfakes and discuss the importance of critical thinking and media literacy.
- **Access the Provided Resources:** Utilize Towner's AI instructional slideshows and the linked resources to support your AI instruction.
- **Join Towner's Magic School NCCE Classroom:** Access additional resources and activities through the provided classroom link.

**Looking Ahead:**

This presentation provides a practical and engaging framework for K-5 educators to introduce AI concepts and tools to their students. By focusing on hands-on activities, interactive learning, and real-world applications, Towner empowers teachers to demystify AI and foster critical thinking and digital literacy skills in young learners. The presentation's emphasis on student agency and creativity encourages exploration and experimentation, allowing students to actively participate in shaping their understanding of AI and its potential. The provided resources and links offer ongoing support for educators seeking to integrate AI into their classrooms.
