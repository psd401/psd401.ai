**AI Action Research '24 Update: Progress, Spotlights, and Future Directions**

This presentation to the PSD Board of Directors on May 21, 2024, provided an update on the district's AI action research, highlighting team progress, teacher spotlights, and plans for the upcoming year.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Multi-Faceted Approach to AI Integration:** PSD has implemented a comprehensive approach to exploring and integrating AI, including a dedicated action research team, digital innovation leads in each building, participation in the CoSN/CGCS/AWS Maturity Pilot, and the adoption of MagicSchool AI.
- **Focus on Professional Development:** The action research team has focused on expanding their own knowledge, improving prompt engineering skills, and building professional development for school staff.
- **Teacher-Led Innovation:** Digital Innovation Leads in each building are actively using and promoting safe AI tools, with 75% of teachers currently utilizing these resources.
- **Classroom Implementation Across Grade Levels:** The presentation showcased diverse examples of AI integration, from exploring AI concepts with K-5 students to supporting research, reading, and study skills in middle and high school.
- **Emphasis on Ethical Considerations:** Teachers are engaging students in discussions about responsible AI use, data management, and the ethical implications of AI.
- **Positive Impact on Student Learning:** Examples from resource room students and co-taught English classes suggest that AI is helping students better understand grade-level material and receive individualized support.
- **Strategic Partnerships:** PSD is partnering with the GH Chamber to provide AI and prompt engineering training for business leaders, demonstrating a commitment to community engagement.

**Actionable Insights:**

- **Review the Action Research Team's Progress:** Consider the team's work in expanding their learning, building staff PD, and designing their own chatbots.
- **Explore the Role of Digital Innovation Leads:** Examine how these building-based representatives are promoting AI tool usage and providing professional development.
- **Study the Teacher Spotlights:** Analyze the diverse examples of AI integration across grade levels and subject areas, including:
  - **Justin Towner (K-5):** Exploring AI concepts, unpacking standards, using AI prompting games, and introducing students to machine learning.
  - **Kayla Frank (7-8 Social Studies):** Using AI for research, reading comprehension, and study support.
  - **Lauren Jarvis (6th Grade LA/SS):** Focusing on AI literacy, ethics, evaluating writing with AI, and using AI for research in social studies.
  - **Danielle Flores (Resource Room):** Helping students understand grade-level text and explore math AI tools.
- **Consider the Impact on Co-Teaching:** Note how AI is being used to design UDL lessons, increase student engagement, and address individual needs in co-taught classrooms.
