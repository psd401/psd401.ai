**From Policy to Practice: Building a District-Wide AI Framework That Works**

This presentation, delivered in February 2025 by Peninsula School District (PSD) Superintendent Krestin Bahr and Chief Information Officer Kris Hagel, details the district's journey in developing and implementing a comprehensive, district-wide AI framework. The focus is on practical application, stakeholder engagement, and iterative improvement.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Strategic Plan Alignment:** PSD's AI initiatives are rooted in their strategic plan, which emphasizes innovation and preparing students to be successful global citizens.
- **Prior Recognition:** The district's early work with AI led to teachers being featured in Time Magazine in August 2023.
- **Guiding Principles:** PSD developed a set of "Principles and Beliefs" to guide responsible AI implementation, and these have been shared and adopted by other districts. A link to an audio deep dive is provided.
- **Focus on Belonging:** AI is presented as a tool to support a sense of belonging within the school community.
- **AI for Focus Group Analysis:** The district has used AI to analyze transcripts from student focus groups, identifying underlying themes and generating follow-up questions. This analysis was then shared back with students using NotebookLM, creating a feedback loop.
- **Stakeholder Perceptions:** The presentation shares data from surveys of teachers, parents, and students, revealing their beliefs, concerns, and usage patterns related to AI.
  - **Teachers:** Primarily view AI as a helpful supplement (40.6%) or see its impact as context-dependent (19.8%).
  - **Parents:** Desire balanced AI exposure and critical thinking skills development, with significant professional AI experience (47%) and interest in AI information sessions (58%).
  - **Students:** Use AI primarily for research (56.5%) and writing/editing (31.5%), with varying frequencies of use and a mix of positive and negative perceptions.
- **Custom GPT for AI Guidance:** PSD developed a custom GPT pre-loaded with resources from UNESCO, TeachAI, Digital Promise, CoSN, and the US Department of Education to help other districts create their own AI guidance documents.
- **CoSN/CGCS K-12 Gen AI Maturity Tool:** The presentation highlights this tool for assessing readiness for responsible GenAI integration and mentions PSD's participation as a pilot district. A "Readiness Rubric Agent" GPT is also mentioned.
- **PSD's AI Website (psd401.ai):** The presentation announces a dedicated website for sharing PSD's AI work, including guidance, blog posts, presentations, tools, articles, and use cases.

**Actionable Insights:**

- **Align AI Initiatives with Strategic Goals:** Ensure that AI implementation supports the district's overall mission and strategic plan.
- **Develop Guiding Principles:** Create a set of principles and beliefs to guide responsible and ethical AI use.
- **Engage Stakeholders:** Collect feedback from teachers, parents, and students to inform AI policies and practices.
- **Leverage AI for Data Analysis:** Use AI tools to analyze qualitative data, such as focus group transcripts, to gain deeper insights.
- **Utilize the Custom GPT for Guidance:** Experiment with the provided custom GPT to develop or refine your district's AI guidance.
- **Assess Readiness with the CoSN/CGCS Tool:** Use the maturity tool to evaluate your district's preparedness for responsible AI integration.
- **Explore PSD's AI Website:** Visit psd401.ai to access resources, learn from PSD's experiences, and stay updated on their progress.

**Looking Ahead:**

This presentation demonstrates PSD's commitment to a thoughtful, iterative, and data-driven approach to AI implementation. By grounding their work in a strategic framework, engaging stakeholders, and leveraging available resources, the district has created a robust AI framework that serves as a model for others. The emphasis on sharing their learning through a dedicated website underscores PSD's leadership role in promoting responsible and effective AI integration in education. The presentation highlights the importance of continuous learning, adaptation, and collaboration in navigating the evolving landscape of AI in schools.
