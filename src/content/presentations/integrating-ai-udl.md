**Integrating Artificial Intelligence with Universal Design for Learning: Enhancing Inclusive Education Through MTSS**

Presented at the Model Schools Conference in 2024 by Kris Hagel and John Yellowlees from the Peninsula School District, this presentation explored the powerful synergy between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) within a Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) framework.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **MTSS as a Foundation for Inclusive Education:** The Peninsula School District (PSD) has been implementing MTSS since 2018, focusing on prevention, problem-solving, and providing all students with access to rigorous grade-level content, alongside Tier II and Tier III supports and enrichment.
- **UDL as a Core Component of MTSS:** PSD integrated UDL into its MTSS framework to ensure Tier I instruction is accessible to all learners, emphasizing multiple means of engagement, representation, and action & expression.
- **AI as a Catalyst for UDL Implementation:** AI was introduced as a powerful tool to further enhance UDL, personalize learning, and provide diverse options for engagement, representation, and expression.
- **Ethical Considerations are Paramount:** The presenters stressed the importance of addressing ethical implications, including data privacy, equity, and potential bias, when integrating AI in education.
- **Professional Learning is Key:** PSD implemented various professional learning initiatives to support teachers in effectively using AI, including the "Innovation with Integrity" action research project, "Everyday AI" cohort, and 1:1 coaching.
- **Focus on Prompt Engineering:** A significant takeaway was the importance of teaching students (and teachers) effective prompt engineering skills to maximize the benefits of AI tools.
- **AI Supports Learner Variability:** The presenters highlighted how AI can provide flexible learning methods and tools that cater to diverse student needs and preferences, such as text leveling, real-world connections, text summarizing, and accommodation suggestions.
- **Positive Impact on Student Outcomes:** The integration of UDL and AI at Henderson Bay Alternative High School resulted in improved student sense of belonging, increased Smarter Balanced ELA proficiency, and a higher graduation rate.

**Actionable Insights:**

- **Review MTSS and UDL Implementation:** Assess your current MTSS framework and consider integrating UDL principles to make core instruction accessible to all learners.
- **Explore AI's Potential to Enhance UDL:** Investigate how AI tools can provide multiple means of engagement, representation, and action & expression in your classrooms.
- **Develop AI Principles and Beliefs:** Establish clear ethical guidelines and considerations for AI use in your school or district, focusing on data privacy, equity, and bias.
- **Implement Comprehensive Professional Learning:** Provide teachers with training on AI tools, prompt engineering, and pedagogical approaches that integrate AI with UDL.
- **Utilize AI for Flexible Learning:** Explore AI tools that can generate texts, create choice boards, provide sentence starters, scaffold assignments, and offer personalized learning supports.
- **Build Custom AI Tools:** Consider developing tailored AI solutions, such as chatbots for teachers or a website analysis tool for community engagement.
- **Monitor Student Outcomes:** Track the impact of AI and UDL integration on student achievement, engagement, and well-being.
- **Learn from the Henderson Bay Example:** Study the successful implementation at Henderson Bay Alternative High School as a model for integrating AI and UDL to improve student outcomes.

**Looking Ahead:**

PSD's future work includes expanding UDL practices with AI, focusing on formative assessment, student reflection, and feedback. They are also developing principal training on prompt engineering, AI training for clerical staff, and custom AI tools to support constituents. The presentation emphasizes that the thoughtful integration of AI with UDL, guided by ethical considerations and supported by professional learning, can create a more inclusive and effective learning environment for all students.
