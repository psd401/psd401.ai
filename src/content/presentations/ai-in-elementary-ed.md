**AI in Elementary Education: Engaging Young Learners with Artificial Intelligence**

This presentation, geared towards elementary educators, explores the practical applications of AI in K-5 classrooms, focusing on hands-on activities and addressing common questions about AI's role in education.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Understanding AI Through Concrete Examples:** The presentation uses relatable examples like virtual assistants, recommendation systems, ride-sharing services, online shopping, and healthcare diagnostics to illustrate how AI is already present in everyday life.
- **Interactive Learning with AI:** Students are introduced to AI concepts through engaging activities:
  - **Datasets and Quick, Draw!:** Understanding how AI makes predictions based on datasets, using pen strokes as an example.
  - **Teachable Machine:** Creating datasets, training a machine learning model, and testing predictions.
  - **Code.org AI For Oceans:** Training a model to differentiate between ocean life and garbage.
  - **Deep Fakes and Altered Images:** Learning about the manipulation of images and videos using AI.
- **"AI or Not?" Game:** A fun and interactive game helps students (and teachers) distinguish between true AI and other technologies, using examples like self-driving cars, automatic doors, and face filters.
- **Classroom Applications of Chatbots:** The presentation suggests various ways to integrate chatbots like ChatGPT into elementary instruction, including interactive storytelling, virtual pen pals, math problem-solving, spelling and vocabulary practice, and virtual show and tell.
- **Emphasis on Teacher Guidance:** While highlighting AI's potential, the presentation underscores the importance of teacher-led instruction and ethical considerations.
- **PSD's AI Policy and Resources:** The presentation references Peninsula School District's "Principles and Beliefs" document on AI, emphasizing AI as a tool to enhance human interaction and improve teaching and learning. Links to various resources, including PSD's FAQs on AI, ChatGPT, Magic School AI, Ludia UDL AI, Code.org's AI 101, Teachable Machine, Quick, Draw!, and CuriPod, are provided.

**Actionable Insights:**

- **Engage Students with Hands-On AI Activities:** Utilize the suggested activities (Quick, Draw!, Teachable Machine, Code.org AI For Oceans) to introduce students to core AI concepts.
- **Explore Chatbots for Interactive Learning:** Experiment with chatbots like ChatGPT for storytelling, virtual pen pals, math problem-solving, and other engaging activities.
- **Review PSD's AI Policy and Resources:** Familiarize yourself with the district's guidelines and utilize the provided resources to deepen your understanding of AI.
- **Consider the "AI or Not?" Framework:** Use the provided questions to help students (and yourself) differentiate between AI and other technologies.
- **Focus on Ethical Considerations:** Engage students in discussions about deep fakes, altered images, and the responsible use of AI.

**Looking Ahead:**

This presentation provides a practical starting point for elementary educators to integrate AI into their classrooms in a meaningful and engaging way. By focusing on hands-on activities, interactive learning, and ethical considerations, teachers can introduce young learners to the fascinating world of AI while fostering critical thinking and digital literacy skills. The presentation encourages a balanced approach, recognizing AI's potential to enhance education while emphasizing the crucial role of teachers in guiding and shaping students' learning experiences.
