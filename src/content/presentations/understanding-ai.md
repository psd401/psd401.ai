**Understanding AI in Education: From Theory to Practice**

This presentation by Kris Hagel, Executive Director of Digital Learning at Peninsula School District, provided an overview of the district's journey in integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education, emphasizing a thoughtful and adaptive approach.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Analogy of AI as Aging:** The presentation cleverly compared adapting to AI to embracing the aging process â€“ it's inevitable, so the wisest strategy is to adapt and make the most of it.
- **Multi-Year AI Journey:** Peninsula School District has been exploring and integrating AI since the spring of 2022, starting with small cohorts of teachers and gradually expanding the initiative.
- **Focus on Teacher Empowerment:** The district prioritized professional development, creating resources like "Everyday AI" and an "AI Action Research" cohort to support teachers in effectively using AI.
- **Ethical Considerations and Guidance:** PSD developed a "Principles and Beliefs" document and a Teacher FAQ to guide responsible AI implementation, addressing issues like equity, detection tools, and documentation of AI usage.
- **Alignment with UDL:** The presentation highlighted the importance of aligning AI integration with Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles to support inclusive education.
- **Emphasis on Practical Application:** The presentation showcased real-world examples of AI use in the classroom, such as the work done by Danielle Flores to support students with special needs.
- **Leveraging External Resources:** PSD utilized resources like the K-12 Generative AI Readiness Checklist from CGCS & COSN, the TeachAI.org Toolkit, and the AASA & COSN EmpowerED Superintendents initiative.

**Actionable Insights:**

- **Embrace an Adaptive Mindset:** Approach AI integration as an ongoing journey, recognizing that the technology and its applications will continue to evolve.
- **Prioritize Teacher Professional Development:** Invest in training and resources to empower teachers to effectively and ethically use AI in their classrooms.
- **Develop Guiding Principles and FAQs:** Create clear guidelines for AI use, addressing ethical considerations, equity concerns, and practical implementation questions.
- **Align AI with UDL:** Explore how AI tools can support the principles of Universal Design for Learning, providing multiple means of engagement, representation, and action & expression.
- **Avoid AI Detection Tools:** Recognize the limitations and potential harm of relying on AI detection tools.
- **Document AI Usage:** Establish practices for documenting the use of AI in generating content or making decisions.
- **Utilize External Frameworks and Resources:** Leverage resources from organizations like CGCS, COSN, TeachAI.org, AASA, and ISTE to guide your AI implementation.

**Looking Ahead:**

The presentation implies that Peninsula School District will continue to explore and expand its use of AI in education, guided by its principles and beliefs, and informed by ongoing professional development and practical classroom experiences. The district's proactive approach serves as a model for other districts seeking to navigate the evolving landscape of AI in education.
