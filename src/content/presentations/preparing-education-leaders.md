**Preparing Education Leaders to Manage AI: A State-Level Playbook**

This presentation, delivered on October 31, 2025, to the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), provides a strategic guide for State Education Agencies (SEAs) on how to effectively support Local Education Agencies (LEAs) and school leaders in navigating the complexities of Artificial Intelligence.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Principles Over Policy:** A central theme is that rigid policies struggle to keep pace with rapid technological change. Instead, leaders should establish enduring principles—such as Human-in-the-Loop, Privacy by Default, Equity by Design, and Transparency—to guide decision-making.
- **Actionable Solutions Over Problem Lists:** The presentation advocates for providing leaders with practical "playbooks" and real-world examples rather than abstract problem catalogs. Guidance should be actionable, with clear next steps.
- **Empower Principal Agency:** Effective state support focuses on empowering school principals and local leaders, avoiding over-centralization of the work. This includes providing resources, training, and networking opportunities.
- **Three Core Needs of LEAs:** State agencies should focus on supporting LEAs in three key areas:
  1.  **Guidance:** Providing principles, model language, and lists of state-approved tools.
  2.  **Capacity-building:** Offering networking opportunities, micro-credentials, and turnkey professional development modules.
  3.  **Infrastructure:** Assisting with clear data privacy language and the setup of secure AI "sandboxes."
- **PSD as a Case Study:** The Peninsula School District's journey is presented as a model of teacher-driven innovation, highlighting the importance of starting with classroom practitioners and learning from the process (including the lesson to involve principals earlier).
- **Addressing Privacy Concerns:** A key technical solution is proposed: running generative AI on SEA or LEA servers to keep all interactions and data governed by existing privacy agreements.

**Actionable Insights for State Leaders:**

- **Focus on Providing Playbooks, Not Problem Lists:** Create practical resources like checklists and templates that local leaders can immediately adapt and use.
- **Prioritize Principles Over Prescriptive Policies:** Develop and share a core set of ethical principles that can guide decision-making in novel situations as technology evolves.
- **Address the Three Core Needs of LEAs:** Strategically plan how your agency can provide support across guidance, capacity-building, and infrastructure.
- **Empower Principals and Local Leaders:** Create opportunities for principals to learn alongside their staff, lead through discomfort, and be nimble in their approach to AI tools.
- **Foster 'Intrapreneurship':** Encourage staff within your own agency and in LEAs to identify problems and construct AI-powered solutions.
- **Investigate Secure Infrastructure:** Explore the feasibility of hosting AI models on state or local servers to provide a secure environment for educators and students.

**Looking Ahead:**

This presentation serves as a call to action for state education leaders to become proactive partners in the AI journey. By shifting the focus from top-down policy to empowering local innovation through guiding principles and actionable support, SEAs can help prepare school leaders to manage AI effectively. The ultimate goal is to build a statewide ecosystem that is ready to leverage AI's potential while responsibly mitigating its risks.
