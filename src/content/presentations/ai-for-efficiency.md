**AI-Powered Efficiency: Enhancing Workflows and Well-Being**

Scheduled for the Peninsula School District Professional Learning Day on August 28, 2024, this presentation focuses on leveraging AI to enhance efficiency, streamline workflows, and improve well-being for educators.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Generative AI Fundamentals:** The presentation introduces generative AI as a rapidly advancing technology with significant potential impacts, emphasizing the importance of understanding and embracing it.
- **The AI Mindset:** It encourages a mindset shift from denial or despair to embracing AI as a tool for increased productivity and a valuable, albeit quirky, colleague.
- **Popular AI Tools:** The presentation highlights popular AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, emphasizing their use for general work and learning, while cautioning against using them with private data without proper agreements.
- **Prompt Priming:** The core concept of prompt priming is introduced, which involves providing specific context to narrow down AI responses and ensure more relevant and tailored outcomes.
- **Advanced Prompting Techniques:** The presentation delves into three key prompt engineering patterns:
  - **Persona Pattern:** Assigning specific roles or viewpoints to the AI (e.g., a historical figure, a friendly tree, a trendy teenager).
  - **Few-Shot Prompting:** Providing examples to guide the AI in generating outputs that follow a desired format or style.
  - **Template Pattern:** Using fill-in-the-blank templates to structure AI outputs and ensure consistency.
- **Peninsula's Primary Tools:** The presentation highlights two primary AI tools used in the district:
  - **MagicSchool.ai:** A platform with various tools for lesson planning, differentiation, communication, and more.
  - **Amplify GenAI:** A district-specific AI tool.

**Actionable Insights:**

- **Embrace the AI Mindset:** Approach AI as a tool to enhance productivity and well-being.
- **Master Prompt Priming:** Provide specific context when interacting with AI to get more relevant and tailored results.
- **Experiment with Prompting Patterns:** Practice using the Persona, Few-Shot, and Template patterns to refine your AI interactions.
- **Utilize Peninsula's Primary Tools:** Explore and leverage MagicSchool.ai and Amplify GenAI to streamline workflows and enhance teaching practices.
- **Engage in Continuous Learning:** Stay updated on the latest AI developments and explore the provided resources (books, articles, prompt libraries) to further enhance your skills.
- **Ask the AI for help:** Use the AI to help you create better prompts and get more specific answers.
- **Join the PSD AI Sharing & Learning Google Chat Space:** Connect with colleagues to share experiences, ask questions, and learn from each other.
