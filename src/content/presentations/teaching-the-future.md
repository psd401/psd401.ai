**Teaching the Future: Preparing Teachers for the Transformative Impact of AI**

This presentation by Kris Hagel, Chief Information Officer at Peninsula School District, outlines the district's journey in preparing teachers for the transformative impact of AI in education, highlighting their proactive approach, professional development initiatives, and lessons learned.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Early Adoption and Exploration:** Peninsula School District began exploring AI's potential in education as early as the spring of 2022, recognizing the significant changes it would bring.
- **Multi-Faceted Professional Development:** The district implemented three distinct professional development paths: "Innovation with Integrity" (action research), "Everyday AI" (small cohort with digital learning coaches), and 1:1 teacher coaching.
- **Focus on Ethical Considerations:** The "Innovation with Integrity" action research project delved into ethical considerations, student perceptions, and the impact of AI on learning.
- **Data Collection and Analysis:** The district collected data through student and teacher surveys, as well as student prompt logs, to understand the evolving landscape of AI use in classrooms.
- **Emphasis on Prompt Engineering:** A key takeaway was the need to improve students' prompt engineering skills, particularly in engaging in follow-up conversations with AI.
- **Addressing Concerns about AI Detectors:** The presentation acknowledged teachers' initial reliance on AI detectors and the need to shift that mindset.
- **Adapting to Changing Circumstances:** The district had to adjust its plans due to staffing changes, moving from district-provided PD to building-based support through Digital Innovation Leads.
- **Leveraging External Resources and Partnerships:** The presentation highlights various resources and initiatives, including "AI for All" during American Education Week and collaborations with other districts and organizations.
- **Building Custom AI Tools:** The district is actively developing custom chatbots and exploring the potential of AI to enhance multilingual support and Universal Design for Learning (UDL).

**Actionable Insights:**

- **Embrace a Proactive Approach:** Recognize the transformative potential of AI in education and take proactive steps to prepare teachers and students.
- **Implement Diverse Professional Development:** Offer a variety of professional learning opportunities to cater to different needs and levels of expertise.
- **Collect and Analyze Data:** Gather data on student and teacher perceptions, usage patterns, and the impact of AI on learning to inform your strategy.
- **Focus on Prompt Engineering:** Equip students and teachers with the skills to effectively interact with AI through well-crafted prompts.
- **Address Ethical Concerns:** Engage in open discussions about the ethical implications of AI, including bias, privacy, and responsible use.
- **Adapt to Changing Circumstances:** Be prepared to adjust your plans based on evolving needs, resources, and external factors.
- **Leverage External Resources and Partnerships:** Collaborate with other districts, organizations, and experts to share knowledge and resources.
- **Explore Custom AI Solutions:** Investigate the potential of building your own AI tools to address specific needs and enhance existing initiatives.
- **Integrate AI with UDL:** Recognize AI's potential to support UDL principles and create more inclusive learning environments.

**Looking Ahead:**

Peninsula School District's future plans include a Fall 2024 kickoff PD on AI basics, MagicSchool.ai, planning for inclusion using AI, and using AI to build student agency. They will also focus on principal professional learning on prompt engineering, an updated cabinet retreat workshop, clerical training on AI, and expanding UDL practices with AI. The district is also building custom AI tools to support constituents. The presentation underscores the importance of ongoing professional development, strategic planning, and a commitment to leveraging AI to enhance teaching, learning, and operational efficiency.
