**Leveraging AI Tools in Your Workplace: A Guide for Business Leaders**

Presented on August 6, 2024, this training focused on empowering business leaders (with a specific focus on examples for K-12 Public School District Leaders) with practical knowledge and skills to effectively utilize AI chatbots in their professional roles. The presentation covered everything from basic chatbot interactions to advanced prompting techniques and real-world applications.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Iterative Prompting is Essential:** The presentation emphasized the importance of iterative conversations with AI chatbots to refine outputs and achieve desired results, moving away from a "one-and-done" approach.
- **Advanced Prompting Techniques Enhance AI Interactions:** Attendees learned four advanced prompting techniques:
  - **Persona Pattern:** Assigning specific roles and characteristics to AI for tailored responses.
  - **Cognitive Verifier Pattern:** Using AI to validate assumptions, decisions, or data.
  - **Few-Shot Prompting:** Guiding AI with examples to achieve desired formats or styles.
  - **Outline Expansion Pattern:** Starting with a basic outline and progressively expanding it with AI's assistance.
- **Custom Instructions and Multi-Modality Expand AI Capabilities:** The presentation explored how custom instructions can personalize AI interactions and how AI can process various modalities, such as documents and images.
- **Custom GPTs Offer Tailored Solutions:** Attendees were introduced to the concept of building custom GPTs, using examples like "How(???)Writes" for analyzing writing style and "Advisory Board 2.0" for ideation.
- **Real-World Applications Drive Efficiency:** The presentation highlighted practical applications of AI in various operational and instructional contexts, including data analysis, lesson planning, and instructional coaching.

**Actionable Insights:**

- **Practice Iterative Prompting:** Engage in ongoing conversations with AI chatbots, refining your prompts to improve the quality of outputs.
- **Master Advanced Prompting Techniques:** Apply the Persona, Cognitive Verifier, Few-Shot, and Outline Expansion patterns to enhance your interactions with AI.
- **Customize AI Interactions:** Utilize custom instructions to personalize your AI chatbot's responses and explore the capabilities of multi-modal AI.
- **Build or Explore Custom GPTs:** Investigate pre-built GPTs or consider building your own to address specific needs and workflows.
- **Embed Prompting Skills in Spreadsheet Tools:** Leverage plugins like "GPT For Work" and "Sheet Co-Pilot" to integrate AI prompting directly into Google Sheets.
- **Explore Real-World Applications:** Consider how AI tools like Securly Discern, Magicschool.ai, and Securly Chat can be used to enhance efficiency and decision-making in your organization.
- **Reflect on the Instructional Coaching and De-Implementation Examples:** Analyze how AI can be used to provide meta-feedback to teachers and to identify areas for de-implementation to create time for new initiatives.

**Looking Ahead:**

The presentation highlighted PSD's next steps, including participating in the CoSN/Council of Great City Schools/AWS Pilot, further integrating UDL and AI, and presenting to the Gig Harbor Chamber on AI for business leaders. The presentation emphasizes the transformative potential of AI in the workplace, encouraging leaders to embrace these tools to improve efficiency, enhance decision-making, and drive innovation.
