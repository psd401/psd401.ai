**AI Meeting the Needs of Diverse Populations: A Superintendent's Perspective**

This presentation, led by Superintendents Krestin Bahr (Peninsula School District) and Bryon Bahr (Rainier School District), explored how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be leveraged to support diverse learners within an educational context.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Contrasting Journeys to AI Integration:** The presenters acknowledged that every district is on a different path, using their own districts as examples of varying approaches to AI implementation.
- **Human-Centered AI Approach:** The "H AI H Approach" - human inquiry, leverage AI, human reflection - was emphasized as a guiding principle for AI integration.
- **PSD's Principles & Beliefs:** Peninsula School District developed a set of principles and beliefs collaboratively with various stakeholders, including teachers and AI tools themselves, to guide responsible AI use.
- **AI to Support UDL and MTSS:** The presenters highlighted how AI can be used to generate texts, create choice boards, provide sentence starters, offer text leveling, summarize complex texts, suggest accommodations, and provide real-world connections â€“ all supporting Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS).
- **Overcoming Analysis Paralysis:** The presenters encouraged attendees to overcome the fear of getting started with AI, emphasizing that even a small amount of time invested can lead to proficiency.

**Actionable Insights:**

- **Reflect on Your District's AI Journey:** Consider where your district is on the path to AI integration and what steps you can take to move forward.
- **Embrace the H AI H Approach:** Guide your AI initiatives with a focus on human inquiry, leveraging AI capabilities, and engaging in human reflection.
- **Develop Guiding Principles:** Create a set of principles and beliefs, in collaboration with stakeholders, to ensure responsible and ethical AI use in your district.
- **Utilize AI to Support UDL and MTSS:** Explore how AI tools can help you provide multiple means of engagement, representation, and action & expression, as well as support tiered interventions.
- **Just Get Started:** Don't let "analysis paralysis" prevent you from exploring AI's potential. Dedicate time to experimenting with AI tools and find what works for you and your students.
- **Leverage Available Resources:** Utilize resources like PSD's AI website, OSPI's Human Centered AI guidelines, and the TeachAI Guidance for Schools toolkit to inform your AI implementation.

**Looking Ahead:**

The presentation highlighted future work in developing custom AI tools to increase inclusion and community engagement. These include:

- **Assistants for Teachers:** Custom chatbots to help teachers tailor lessons based on student preferences and UDL principles.
- **AI Analysis of Strategic Plan Data:** A website tool for the community to analyze public strategic plan metrics.
- **Digital Wellness Coach:** A chatbot to help parents with challenging questions about their children's phone and social media use.

The presentation underscores the potential of AI to meet the needs of diverse learners and improve educational outcomes when implemented thoughtfully and ethically. It encourages educators to embrace a proactive approach to AI integration, leveraging available resources and focusing on practical applications that support student success.
