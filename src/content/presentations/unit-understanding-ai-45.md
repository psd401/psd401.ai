**4/5 Unit: Artificial Intelligence (AI) - A Deeper Dive for Upper Elementary**

This unit plan introduces 4th and 5th-grade students to Artificial Intelligence (AI) through a series of interactive activities, expanding on concepts from earlier grades and delving into more complex applications like facial recognition.

**Key Concepts:**

- **What is AI?** AI is defined as code that simulates human intelligence, enabling machines to understand language, recognize patterns, and make decisions.
- **Types of AI:** While not explicitly stated, the activities touch upon reactive, predictive, and generative AI.
- **Datasets:** The concept of datasets as collections of curated data (images, measurements, text, video) that power AI is reinforced.
- **Machine Learning:** Students explore machine learning through Teachable Machine, creating datasets and training models for image classification. There is a focus on testing and accuracy.
- **Coding and Algorithms:** While not explicitly focused on coding, the use of chatbots and image generators implicitly introduces students to the idea of providing instructions to a computer.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Students will understand a general definition of AI.
- Students will understand that AI is based on datasets.
- Students will be able to use Google's Quick Draw to see how AI "thinks" and makes predictions.
- Students will understand the analogy of machine learning as a cake (explained through a video).
- Students can have a teacher use an AI image generator to create a visual representation of their creative writing.
- Students can learn and interact with machine learning by interacting with the Teachable Machine website, including creating data points, training the machine, and testing its accuracy.
- Students can work with a small group to add a set of story elements for a chatbot to generate a story.
- Students can explore with any of the AI learning tools used in the unit.

**Activities:**

- **Day 1: What is AI and Data Sets with QuickDraw:** Introduction to AI and datasets using Google's Quick Draw. Students play a game where they draw for an AI and it tries to guess what they are drawing.
- **Day 2: Creative Writing using Schoology Discussion and AI Image Generators:** Students engage in creative writing and use AI image generators to create visuals based on their stories, using a Schoology discussion forum.
- **Day 3: Machine Learning with Teachable Machine:** Students create datasets and train a machine learning model for image classification. They are encouraged to create and test various models. Examples are given for testing colors, numbers, objects, and facial recognition.
- **Day 4: Story Writing with AI Chatbots:** Students use chatbots like ChatGPT to help them write stories, collaborating in small groups and using a Schoology discussion forum.
- **Day 5: Free Choice with AI Tools:** Students choose from various AI tools (Quick Draw, image generators, Teachable Machine, ChatBot storytelling) to explore further.

**Assessment:**

- **Unit Rubric:** Based on ELA and ISTE standards, focusing on writing narratives and curating information from digital resources.

**Additional Notes:**

- **"AI or Not?" Game:** A game to help students distinguish between AI and non-AI technologies.
- **"What Cake Can Teach Us About AI" Video:** An analogy to help students understand machine learning.
- **Teachable Machine:** Students train a model to recognize different images. The 4/5 version provides more detailed instructions on creating varied datasets and testing different models, such as for colors, numbers, objects, and even facial recognition.

**Looking Ahead:**

This unit plan provides a more advanced introduction to AI for 4th and 5th-grade students compared to the K/1 and 2/3 versions. It delves deeper into machine learning concepts and provides more opportunities for experimentation and exploration. The use of Teachable Machine allows students to actively participate in training AI models and understanding the importance of datasets. By engaging in creative writing and using AI image generators and chatbots, students experience the practical applications of AI in a fun and engaging way. The unit lays a solid foundation for further exploration of AI and its growing role in various fields.
