**Artificial Intelligence: Mastering Prompt Engineering**

This professional development session, held on March 15, 2024, focused on equipping staff with the skills to effectively utilize AI chatbots through prompt engineering, covering both basic and advanced techniques.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Iterative Prompting:** The session emphasized the importance of iterative conversations with AI chatbots, encouraging participants to refine their prompts and engage in ongoing dialogue to achieve desired results. It highlighted the concept that using AI is more like chiseling away at rock than using a hammer.
- **Advanced Prompting Techniques:** Participants were introduced to two advanced prompting techniques:
  - **Persona Pattern:** Assigning specific roles and characteristics to the AI (e.g., an expert in interactive lesson design, a public health advisor) to elicit more tailored and relevant responses.
  - **Few-Shot Prompting:** Providing the AI with a few examples of the desired output format or style to guide its responses (e.g., providing sample multiple-choice questions to generate similar ones).
- **Practical Application:** The session included hands-on activities where participants practiced crafting prompts using the persona and few-shot prompting techniques, focusing on real-world challenges they face in their roles.
- **Prompt Libraries as Resources:** Participants were introduced to various prompt libraries, including AI For Education Prompt Library, Prompts4All, and Microsoft Prompts for Education, as resources to support their prompt engineering efforts.
- **Emphasis on Conversational Approach:** It was emphasized that AI is not a search engine, but rather a conversational partner.

**Actionable Insights:**

- **Practice Iterative Prompting:** Engage in ongoing conversations with AI chatbots, refining prompts based on the responses received.
- **Utilize the Persona Pattern:** Experiment with assigning different personas to the AI to elicit responses tailored to specific needs and contexts.
- **Apply Few-Shot Prompting:** Provide examples to guide the AI in generating outputs that align with desired formats and styles.
- **Explore Prompt Libraries:** Leverage the provided prompt libraries as resources for inspiration and guidance in crafting effective prompts.
- **View AI as a Conversational Partner:** Approach AI interactions as conversations rather than one-off queries.
- **Experiment with Canva:** Try to replicate pictures using Canva's AI image generator.
- **Use Google Gemini:** Get practice with using and iterating on prompts in Gemini.

**Looking Ahead:**

This professional development session provides a solid foundation in prompt engineering, equipping staff with practical skills and resources to effectively leverage AI chatbots in their work. By mastering these techniques, participants can enhance their efficiency, creativity, and problem-solving capabilities. The session encourages ongoing experimentation and exploration of AI tools, emphasizing the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence.
