**Artificial Intelligence, Prompt Engineering & Deepening Our Usage: A Guide for PSD Leaders**

This presentation, delivered at the Peninsula School District (PSD) Cabinet Retreat on February 28, 2024, aimed to deepen the understanding and application of AI, particularly prompt engineering, among district leaders.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Iterative Prompting as a Core Skill:** The presentation emphasized the importance of iterative conversations with AI chatbots, highlighting the analogy of chiseling away at rock to refine outputs.
- **Advanced Prompting Techniques:** Attendees were introduced to advanced techniques for maximizing the effectiveness of AI interactions:
  - **Persona Pattern:** Assigning specific roles and characteristics to the AI (e.g., an expert in interactive lesson design, a public health advisor).
  - **Cognitive Verifier Pattern:** Using AI to validate assumptions, decisions, or data, acting as a knowledgeable colleague.
  - **Few-Shot Prompting:** Providing examples to guide the AI towards desired output formats or styles.
  - **Outline Expansion Pattern:** Starting with a broad outline and using AI to progressively add details and expand on specific sections.
- **Custom Instructions and Multi-Modality:** The presentation explored how custom instructions can personalize AI interactions (using Kris Hagel's detailed example) and how AI can process various modalities like documents and images (using Claude as an example).
- **Custom GPTs for Specific Tasks:** Attendees were introduced to the concept of building custom GPTs, with examples like "How(???)Writes" for analyzing writing style and "Advisory Board 2.0" for brainstorming.
- **Real-World Applications in PSD:** The presentation highlighted practical applications of AI within the district, including using AI for instructional coaching feedback and exploring the concept of "de-implementation" to make time for new initiatives.

**Actionable Insights:**

- **Practice Iterative Prompting:** Engage in ongoing conversations with AI chatbots, refining prompts based on the responses received.
- **Master Advanced Prompting Techniques:** Apply the Persona, Cognitive Verifier, Few-Shot, and Outline Expansion patterns to enhance AI interactions.
- **Create and Utilize Custom Instructions:** Develop personalized instructions for AI chatbots to tailor responses to your specific needs and preferences.
- **Explore Multi-Modal Capabilities:** Experiment with uploading documents and images to AI chatbots to extract insights and analyze data.
- **Investigate Custom GPTs:** Explore pre-built custom GPTs or consider building your own to address specific tasks or workflows.
- **Embed Prompting Skills in Spreadsheets:** Utilize plugins like "GPT For Work" and "Sheet Co-Pilot" to integrate AI prompting directly into Google Sheets.
- **Review PSD's Current AI Initiatives:** Familiarize yourself with how AI is being used in the district, including Securly Discern, Magicschool.ai, and Securly Chat.
- **Reflect on Instructional Coaching and De-Implementation Examples:** Analyze how AI can be used to improve feedback and create time for new initiatives.

**Looking Ahead:**

The presentation outlined PSD's next steps in its AI journey:

- **CoSN / Council of Great City Schools / AWS Pilot:** Participating in a national pilot to build out a Maturity Matrix for AI implementation.
- **UDL / AI Integration:** Continuing to lead in AI by merging MTSS/UDL work with AI capabilities.
- **Gig Harbor Chamber Lunch Presentation:** Sharing AI knowledge and practical applications with business leaders in the community.

The presentation underscores PSD's commitment to deepening its understanding and application of AI, moving beyond basic usage to more advanced techniques and custom solutions. By focusing on prompt engineering, custom instructions, and real-world applications, the district aims to leverage AI to enhance leadership, decision-making, and overall organizational effectiveness. The emphasis on collaboration, both internally and with external partners, highlights PSD's proactive and strategic approach to navigating the evolving landscape of AI in education.
