**Professional Learning Day: Introduction to AI**

This professional development session provides educators with a foundational understanding of AI, focusing on the distinctions between reactive, predictive, and generative AI, and practical applications of generative AI tools in the classroom.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Defining AI:** The presentation defines AI as code that simulates human intelligence, performing tasks like understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. It further categorizes AI into three types:
  - **Reactive AI:** Responds to specific inputs without learning.
  - **Predictive AI:** Analyzes data to predict future events.
  - **Generative AI:** Creates new content based on learned patterns.
- **PSD's Belief on AI:** The Peninsula School District believes AI can intensify the human element in education.
- **Understanding Key Terms:** Participants are introduced to key terms like LLM (Large Language Model) and NLP (Natural Language Process), and the concept of H-AI-H (Human Inquiry - AI - Human Empowerment) is presented.
- **Hands-On Activities:** The session includes several hands-on activities:
  - **AI Tool Progression Sort:** Categorizing real-world AI tools as reactive, predictive, or generative.
  - **Image Generation with Canva:** Attempting to recreate images using Canva's AI image generator, focusing on iterative prompting.
  - **Text Generation with MagicSchool.ai:** Using MagicSchool.ai's Team Builder/Ice Breaker bot and other tools to generate content, emphasizing the importance of well-crafted prompts.
  - **Self-Directed Exploration:** Participants explore various MagicSchool.ai tools based on their interests and teaching needs, creating a product relevant to their first week of school scenarios.
- **Prompt Engineering Frameworks:** Two frameworks for crafting effective prompts are introduced:
  - **Five "S" Model:** Set the Scene, Specific Request, Simplify the Language, Structure the Output, Share Feedback.
  - **Best PARTS of Prompt Building:** Persona, Audience, Relevant, Tone, Specific.
- **Best Practices for AI Usage:** The presentation emphasizes checking for bias, using the 80-20 approach (AI for initial work, human refinement), using human judgment, and protecting student privacy.
- **Introduction to Tools:** Participants receive a tour of Canva and create MagicSchool.ai accounts.

**Actionable Insights:**

- **Differentiate Between AI Types:** Understand the distinctions between reactive, predictive, and generative AI.
- **Master Prompt Engineering:** Practice using the Five "S" Model and the PARTS framework to craft effective prompts.
- **Explore Canva and MagicSchool.ai:** Experiment with these tools to generate images, create lesson plans, and explore other functionalities.
- **Apply AI in Practical Ways:** Use AI to create team builders, icebreakers, UDL choice boards, lesson plans, and other resources.
- **Follow Best Practices:** Always check for bias, use AI as a starting point, exercise your judgment, and protect student privacy.
- **Complete the Exit Ticket:** Demonstrate your understanding of the day's learning by completing the exit ticket.
- **Utilize the Provided Resources:** Explore the training resources for MagicSchool.ai and Canva.

**Looking Ahead:**

This introductory session provides a solid foundation for educators to begin integrating AI tools into their practice. By understanding the different types of AI, mastering prompt engineering techniques, and exploring practical applications, participants are well-equipped to leverage AI for enhanced teaching and learning. The hands-on activities and emphasis on best practices ensure that educators can confidently and responsibly integrate these powerful tools into their classrooms. The session encourages ongoing exploration and provides resources for continued learning and support.
