**From Policy to Practice: Building a District-Wide AI Framework That Works**

This presentation focuses on the crucial transition from developing AI policies to implementing a practical, district-wide AI framework. It emphasizes the importance of adapting and adjusting as you go, based on feedback from students, parents, and staff, rather than planning everything out perfectly in advance. The presentation also delves into federal policy considerations, highlighting the need for flexible, broad policies and regulations that reflect existing best practices in technology, equity, and accessibility.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Adaptive Implementation:** The presentation advocates for an iterative approach to AI implementation, starting with practical steps and adjusting based on feedback, rather than a rigid, pre-planned approach.
- **Federal Policy Considerations:**
  - **What's Going On:** Acknowledges the limited federal action specific to AI in education.
  - **What's Possible:** Recognizes the vast potential of AI.
  - **What's Appropriate:** Focuses on policy and regulation, funding and resources, research and innovation, and guidance and oversight.
- **Local Policy Considerations:** Sound local policy should balance opportunities and challenges, focusing on:
  - Purpose (Instruction/Pedagogy Alignment)
  - Data Privacy and Security
  - Equity and Accessibility
  - Professional Development (Capacity Building)
  - Community/Stakeholder Engagement
  - Evaluation and Accountability
  - Ethical Considerations
- **Peninsula School District's (PSD) Strategic Plan:** PSD's strategic plan, with its mission to be the best school district and its focus on innovation, provides a strong foundation for AI integration.
- **PSD's Guiding Documents and Resources:** The presentation highlights PSD's "Principles and Beliefs" document, FAQs, and website (psd401.net/ai) as valuable resources for other districts. There is also a link to an audio deep dive of their guidance.
- **Stakeholder Perceptions:** Surveys reveal:
  - **Teachers:** See AI as a helpful supplement (40.6%) or having a context-dependent impact (19.8%).
  - **Parents:** Desire balanced AI exposure and critical thinking skills development, with 47% having professional AI experience and 58% interested in AI information sessions.
  - **Students:** Use AI primarily for research (56.5%) and writing/editing (31.5%), with varying frequencies of use.
- **Student Benefits and Concerns:**
  - **Benefits:** Students cite improved understanding and efficiency (33.3%).
  - **Concerns:** Accuracy, over-dependence, impact on genuine learning, and privacy.
- **Custom GPT for Building AI Guidance:** A custom GPT is introduced, pre-loaded with resources like UNESCO's recommendations and guidelines, TeachAI's toolkit, Digital Promise's framework, CoSN's reports, and the US Department of Education's resources. This GPT can assist districts in developing their own AI guidance.
- **CoSN/CGCS K-12 Gen AI Maturity Tool:** The presentation highlights this tool for assessing preparedness for responsible GenAI integration and mentions PSD's participation as a pilot district.
- **PSD's AI Website (psd401.ai):** A new website dedicated to sharing PSD's work on AI, including guidance, blog posts, presentations, tools, curated articles, and a catalog of use cases.

**Actionable Insights:**

- **Embrace an Iterative Approach:** Start with practical AI implementation and adapt based on feedback.
- **Consider Federal Policy Implications:** Advocate for flexible, broad policies and regulations that align with existing best practices.
- **Develop Local Guiding Principles:** Create policies that address purpose, data privacy, equity, professional development, stakeholder engagement, evaluation, and ethics.
- **Leverage PSD's Resources:** Utilize PSD's "Principles and Beliefs" document, FAQs, and website as models for your own district.
- **Engage Stakeholders:** Collect and analyze feedback from teachers, parents, and students to inform your AI strategy.
- **Utilize the Custom GPT:** Experiment with the provided custom GPT to develop or refine your district's AI guidance.
- **Assess Your District's Readiness:** Use the CoSN/CGCS K-12 Gen AI Maturity Tool to evaluate your preparedness for responsible AI integration.
- **Explore PSD's AI Website:** Visit psd401.ai to learn more about PSD's work and access valuable resources.

**Looking Ahead:**

This presentation provides a comprehensive overview of the considerations and steps involved in building a district-wide AI framework. By emphasizing an adaptive approach, highlighting key policy considerations, and showcasing practical examples from the Peninsula School District, the presentation offers a valuable roadmap for districts navigating the complex landscape of AI in education. The focus on stakeholder engagement, ethical considerations, and continuous improvement underscores the importance of a thoughtful and responsible approach to AI integration.
